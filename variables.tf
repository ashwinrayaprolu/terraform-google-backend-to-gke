###--- Required inputs ---###

variable "neg-name" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    Required name assigned to the Network Endpoint Group you created via
    an annotation added to your Kubernetes Service resource.

    Example: neg-name = "api"
    would work with the following Service annotation:
      cloud.google.com/neg: '{"exposed_ports": {"80": {"name": "api"}}}'
  EOD
  type          = string

  validation {
    condition       = "" != var.neg-name
    error_message   = "Must not be \"\"."
  }
}


###--- Clusters ---###

# At least one of "clusters" and "cluster-objects" must not be empty.

variable "clusters" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    A map from GCP Compute Region (or Zone) name to GKE Cluster Name in
    that Region/Zone.  The cluster name can be "$${project-id}/$${name}"
    to use a cluster in a different GCP Project.  This and/or
    `cluster-objects` must not be empty.
    Example:
      clusters = { us-central1 = "gke-my-product-prd-usc1" }
  EOD
  type          = map(string)
  default       = {}
}

variable "cluster-objects" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    A list of google_container_cluster resource objects.  Usually, each
    is a reference to a resource or data declaration.  But all that is
    required is that each object have an appropriate value for
    `node_locations` (a list of Compute Zone names).
    Example: cluster-list = [
      google_container_cluster.usc, data.google_container_cluster.legacy ]
  EOD
  type          = list(object({node_locations=list(string)}))
  default       = []
}


###--- Generic customization inputs ---###

variable "project" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    The ID of the GCP Project that resources will be created in.  Defaults
    to "" which uses the default project of the Google client configuration.

    Example: project = "my-gcp-project"
  EOD
  type          = string
  default       = ""
}

variable "name-prefix" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    An optional prefix string to prepend to the `.name` of the GCP resources
    created by this module.  If left as "", then "$${neg-name}-" will be used.
    Can be useful when migrating to or testing a new configuration.

    Example: name-prefix = "v2-"
  EOD
  type          = string
  default       = ""
}

variable "description" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    An optional description to be used on every created resource.

    Example: description = "Created by Terraform module backend-to-gke"
  EOD
  type          = string
  default       = ""
}


###--- Health check options ---###

variable "health-ref" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    Either the name given to a Health Check resource in this project,
    "$${project-id}/$${name}" for a Health Check in a different project,
    just a full Health Check resource `.id`, or "" to have a generic
    Health Check created.

    Examples:
      health-ref = "api-hc"
      health-ref = google_compute_health_check.hc.id
  EOD
  type          = string
  default       = ""
}

variable "health-path" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    Path to use in created Health Check (only if `health-ref` left as "").
    Example: health-path = "/ready"
  EOD
  type          = string
  default       = "/"
}

variable "health-interval-secs" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    How long to wait between health checks, in seconds.

    Example: health-interval-sec = 10
  EOD
  type          = number
  default       = 5
}

variable "health-timeout-secs" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    How long to wait for a reply to a health check, in seconds.

    Example: health-timeout-sec = 10
  EOD
  type          = number
  default       = 5
}

variable "unhealthy-threshold" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    How many failed health checks before a Backend instance is considered
    unhealthy (thus no longer routing requests to it).

    Example: unhealthy-threshold = 1
  EOD
  type          = number
  default       = 2
}

variable "healthy-threshold" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    How many successful health checks to an unhealthy Backend instance
    are required before the Backend is considered healthy (thus again
    routing requests to it).

    Example: healthy-threshold = 1
  EOD
  type          = number
  default       = 2
}


###--- Backend options ---###

variable "lb-scheme" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    Defaults to "EXTERNAL_MANAGED" ["Modern" Global L7 HTTP(S) LB].
    Can be set to "EXTERNAL" ["Classic" Global L7 HTTP(S) LB].  Set to ""
    to skip creation of the Backend (see "Custom Backend" in README.md).
  EOD
  type          = string
  default       = "EXTERNAL_MANAGED"

  validation {
    condition       = ( var.lb-scheme == "" ||
      var.lb-scheme == "EXTERNAL" || var.lb-scheme == "EXTERNAL_MANAGED" || var.lb-scheme == "INTERNAL_MANAGED" )
    error_message   = "Must be \"EXTERNAL\", \"EXTERNAL_MANAGED\", \"INTERNAL_MANAGED\", or \"\"."
  }
}

variable "log-sample-rate" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    The fraction [0.0 .. 1.0] of requests to your Backend Service that should
    be logged.  Setting this to 0.0 will set `log_config.enabled = false`.

    Example: log-sample-rate = 0.01
  EOD
  type          = number
  default       = 1.0
}

variable "max-rps-per" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    The maximum requests-per-second that load balancing will send per
    endpoint (per pod); set as `max_rate_per_endpoint` in the created
    Backend Service.  Setting this value too low can cause problems (it
    will not cause more pods to be spun up but just cause requests to
    be rejected).  It is possible to use this as a worst-case rate limit
    that is one part of protecting your pods from excessive request
    volume, but doing this requires considerable care.  So err on the
    side of setting it too high rather than too low.

    Example: max-rps-per = 5000
  EOD
  type          = number
  default       = 1000
}

variable "timeout-secs" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    The maximum number of seconds that load balancing will wait to receive a
    full response from your Workload.  You should set this value to be longer
    than you expect your Workload to ever reasonably take to respond.  Taking
    longer than this time will, unfortunately, cause load balancing to retry
    the request.  A retry can be useful in some situations, but retrying
    after a long timeout is a terrible idea (bad for user experience and
    likely just adds useless extra load to a Workload that may be responding
    slowly because it is overloaded).  You should also implement your own
    timeout in your Workload that is shorter than this value.
  EOD
  type          = number
  default       = 30
}

variable "security-policy" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    The `.id` of a Cloud Armor security policy to apply to your Workload.

    Example: security-policy = google_compute_security_policy.my-api.id
  EOD
  type          = string
  default       = ""
}

variable "session-affinity" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    Defaults to "NONE".  Can be set to "CLIENT_IP" to use a best-effort
    session affinity based on the client's IP address.
  EOD
  type          = string
  default       = "NONE"

  validation {
    condition       = (
      var.session-affinity == "NONE" || var.session-affinity == "CLIENT_IP" )
    error_message   = "Must be \"NONE\" or \"CLIENT_IP\"."
  }
}

variable "iap-id" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    The OAuth2 Client ID required for Identity-Aware Proxy.  Setting this
    causes IAP to be enabled.

    Example: iap-id = google_iap_client.my-api.client_id
  EOD
  type          = string
  default       = ""
}

variable "iap-secret" {
  description   = <<-EOD
    The OAuth2 Client Secret required for Identity-Aware Proxy.

    Example: iap-secret = google_iap_client.my-api.secret
  EOD
  type          = string
  default       = ""
}
